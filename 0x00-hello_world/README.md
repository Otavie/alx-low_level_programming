- The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE
- The output should be saved in the file c

### 1-compiler
A script that compiles a C file but does not link,
- The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE
- The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .o instead of .c

### 2-assembler
A script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.
- The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE
- The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .s instead of .c

### 3-name
A script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun
- The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE

### 4-puts.c
A C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle", followed by a new line.
- Use the function puts
- You are not allowed to use printf
Your program should end with the value 0

### 5-printf.c

- You are not allowed to use the function puts
- Your program should return 0
- Your program should compile without warning when using the -Wall gcc option

### 6-size.c
A C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.

- Warnings are allowed
- Your program should return 0
- You might have to install the package libc6-dev-i386 on your Linux to test the -m32 gcc option

### 100-intel
A script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file.
- The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE.
- The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .s instead of .c

### 101-quote.c
