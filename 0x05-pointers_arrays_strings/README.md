# 0x05. C - POINTERS, ARRAYS AND STRINGS

The directory contains the following tasks:

### 0-reset_to_98.c
A function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.
- Prototype: void reset_to_98(int \*n);

### 1-swap.c
A function that swaps the values of two integers.
- Prototype: void swap_int(int \*a, int \*b);

### 2-strlen.c
A function that returns the length of a string.
- Prototype: int \_strlen(char \*s);

### 3-puts.c
A function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.
- Prototype: void \_puts(char \*str);

### 4-print_rev.c
A function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.
- Prototype: void print_rev(char \*s);

### 5-rev_string.c
A function that reverses a string.
- Prototype: void rev_string(char \*s);

### 6-puts2.c
A function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.
- Prototype: void puts2(char \*str);

### 7-puts_half.c
A function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.
- Prototype: void puts_half(char \*str);
- The function should print the second half of the string
- If the number of characters is odd, the function should print the last n characters of the string, where n = (length_of_the_string - 1) / 2

### 8-print_array.c
A function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.
- Prototype: void print_array(int \*a, int n);
- where n is the number of elements of the array to be printed
- Numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space
- The numbers should be displayed in the same order as they are stored in the array
- You are allowed to use printf

### 9-strcpy.c
A function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.
- Prototype: char \*\_strcpy(char \*dest, char \*src);
- Return value: the pointer to dest
