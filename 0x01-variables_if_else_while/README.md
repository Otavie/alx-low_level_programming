# 0x01. C - VARIABLES , IF, ELSE, WHILE

This directory conatins the following tasks:

### 0-positive_or_negative.c
This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative. The variables n will store a different value every time you run the this program. The output of the program should be the number followed by:
- if the number is greater than 0: is positive
- if the number is 0: is zero
- if the number is less than 0: is negative

### 1-last_digit.c
This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n. The variable n will store a different value every time you run this program. The output of the program should be the string 'Last digit of' followed by:
- n followed by the string 'is' followed by:
    - the string 'and is greater than 5' if the last digit is of n is greater than 5
    - the string 'and is 0' if the last digit of n is 0
    - the string 'and is less than 6 and not 0' if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0

### 2-print_alphabet.c
A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc.) is a forbidden)
- All your code should be in the main function
- You can only use putchar twice in your code

### 3-print_alphabets.c
A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.
- The putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden) can be used
- All the code should be in the main function
- The putchar can be used three times in the code

### 4-print_alphabt.c
A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- Print all the letters except q and e
- The putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden) can be used.
- All the code should be in the main function
- The putchar can be used twice in your code

### 5-print_numbers.c
A program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line. All the code should be in the main function.

### 6-print_numberz.c
A program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
- The program is not allowed to use any variable of type char
- The putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden) can be used
- The putchar can be used only twice in the code
- All the code should be in the main function

### 7-print_tebahpla.c
A program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.
- The putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden) can be used
- All the code should be in the main function
- The putchar can be used twice only in the code

### 8-print_base16.c
A program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- The putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden) can be used
- All the code should be in the main function
- The putchar can be used only three times in your code

### 9-print_comb.c
A program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
- Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
- Numbers should be printed in ascending order
- The putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden) can be used
- All the code should be in the main function
- The putchar can only be used only four times maximum in your code
